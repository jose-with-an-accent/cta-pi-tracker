# CTA Pi Tracker
This project intends to be a tool to check the timetables of CTA buses, with possible additional uses in the future. It's made with a class in mind about how to use Raspberry Pis.

The project uses Whisper for voice control. The UI is built with React and for simplicity comes with a Python backend that communicates via WebSockets. It's all wrapped into Tauri for something that will, in the future, be unified.
